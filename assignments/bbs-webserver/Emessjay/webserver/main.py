main.py — FastAPI BBS webserver (Assignment 2, gold tier).

READING GUIDE
─────────────
This file has four layers, top to bottom:

  1. Lifespan + app setup    — runs init_db() on startup.
  2. Pydantic models         — request validation (UserCreate,
                               PostCreate, UserPatch, PostPatch,
                               BoardPostCreate) and response shape
                               lockdown (UserOut, PostOut, BoardOut).
  3. Row → dict helpers + SQL fragments + the shared _insert_post().
  4. Route handlers, grouped by resource.  Raw SQL (no ORM) because
     the schema is small enough that ORM machinery would obscure
     the logic.

WHY PYDANTIC MODELS FOR BOTH REQUESTS AND RESPONSES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The spec says response bodies must contain EXACTLY the listed fields.
The naive implementation — returning dict(row) straight from SQLite —
leaks internal columns like user_id.  By declaring response_model on
each route, FastAPI filters the outgoing dict against the model's
fields before serialising.  Any stray field silently drops; any
missing field raises a server error that surfaces in tests.  Field-
shape correctness comes for free.

WHY RAW SQL INSTEAD OF AN ORM
──────────────────────────────
SQLAlchemy would add 200+ lines of boilerplate for a schema with two
tables and a handful of queries.  Raw SQL parameterised with `?` is
safe against injection (the sqlite3 driver binds values properly),
readable, and mirrors A1's teaching so students can trace from one
assignment to the next.  Silver's correlated subquery for post_count
is three lines of SQL; hiding it inside an ORM relationship would
just cost an extra query per user.

TIER RECAP (read top-to-bottom for the evolution)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bronze
  8 endpoints: CRUD-ish on /users and /posts.  Hard delete.
  X-Username header for identity on POST /posts (not auth).
  Field shapes: user={username, created_at}; post={id, username,
  message, created_at}.
Silver
  User responses gain `bio` (nullable, editable) and `post_count`
  (computed, never stored).  Post responses gain `updated_at` (null
  until the first PATCH).  New: PATCH /users/{username} (bio),
  PATCH /posts/{id} (message, ownership-enforced via X-Username),
  and GET /posts?username=X filter.
Gold
  Posts gain `board` (NOT NULL DEFAULT 'general').  New endpoints:
  GET /boards, GET /boards/{name}/posts, POST /boards/{name}/posts
  (URL-authoritative; body cannot carry `board`).  GET /posts gains
  a `?board=` filter that composes with the other filters.  Boards
  are implicit — no `boards` table — and exist as long as any post
  references them.

    original author (as stored on the row) can edit it, and that
    identity is claimed via the X-Username header.

    Order of checks (matters for the response code):
      400 — X-Username missing or empty
      404 — post does not exist
      403 — post exists but X-Username does not match the author
      422 — body fails validation (Pydantic) OR explicit null message
      200 — OK (includes {} no-op case, which leaves updated_at alone)

    The 404-before-403 ordering means an unknown post id always
    looks the same to any caller, regardless of whether they own it.
    That is the plain-REST default; a security-hardened build might
    flip this to 403-everywhere to avoid leaking whether an id
    exists, but bronze is not worried about that.
